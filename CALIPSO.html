## Introducing CALIPSO 

.pull-left[
CALIPSO is a type of active satellite sensor which stands for **Cloud-Aerosol LiDAR and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations**.

It was first launched in April 2006 and was recently discontinued in September 2023. CALIPSO's main maission was to _"profile the vertical distribution of clouds and aerosols and their role in heating/cooling the Earth"_

CALIPSO was operated by both NASA and CNES with the aims to measure cloud type, cloud top temperature, atmospheric temperatue fields, cloud particle properties and aerosols.

## How CALIPSO works 
.pull-left[
In order to carry out its mission, CALIPSO was designed to include three instruments for Earth observations:
- **CALIOP** - a cloud-aerosol LiDAR with orthogonal polarisation (uses a two-wavelength laser transmitter)
- **IIR** - imaging infrared radiometer (provides context for nighttime observations)
- **WFC** - wide field camera (provides context for daytime observations)

## What CALIPSO was used for

.pull-left[
According to NASA Earth Observatory, there are several ways that CALPISO benefitted researchers during its mission:
- LiDAR data helped determine the altitudes of clouds and aerosol layers
- This also enabled the size of the aerosols to be calculated
- Outgoing heat emissions were captured by the three-channel imaging infrared radiometer
- High-resolution camera was able to detect whether image measurements dervied from a large air mass or small isolated clouds

## CALIPSO in remote sensing

.pull-left[
The CALIPSO satellite is part of NASA's "A-Train constellation" which were chosen to provide a _"comprehensive suite of measurements, both passive and active, to enable improved understanding of the Earth’s atmosphere"_.

Research claims that CALIPSO is known as a "backscatter satellite" which measures the "full extent of the troposphere" (McGill et al. 2007)

According to McGill measuring the backscattered signal at multiple wavelengths _"provides information about cloud and aerosol optical properties and the depolarization measurement can be used to determine the ice-water phase of clouds"_.

## Case study over the Caribbean Sea

Tackett &amp; Di Girolamo pioneered a study in 2009 over the Caribbean Sea, where they used CALIPSO to study the transition zone.

Key findings:
- _"aerosol properities change rapidly near clouds both because aerosols swell in the humid environment"_
- _"collision an coalescene of aerosol-containing cloud droplets and their subsequent evaporation produce fewer but larger aerosol particles"_ 

Várnai &amp; Marshak (2011) conducted a similar study following the methods used in the previous study. Their findings revealed that _"more clear profiles lie close to clouds below 3 km than to higher clouds, even though the highest cloud top is more often above than below 3 km"_. 

Desipte this, Várnai &amp; Marshak acknowledged issues with the CALIPSO satellite in remote sensing where it wasn't able to detect aerosol layers due to the _"lidar backscatter and color ratio increase near clouds even in pristine atmospheric columns"_.

## CALIPSO over the Atlantic Basin

.pull-left[
Adams et al. (2012) used CALIPSO's VFM (vertical feature mask) to gain insight on the temporal and spatial distribution of aerosols in the given regions.

Their study found that _"the distribution of Total Aerosol is chiefly determined by the presence of either Dust or Smoke or the combination of the two"_.

However they also picked up on a limitation to CALIPSO's sensors where they question the detection threshold for dust, which could potentially alter their interpretations if incorrect. 

Therefore, both studies reflected on the accuracy of CALIPSO's detection for different reasons, but this may still imply that the satellite perhaps did not perform to its full potential despite being a "backscatter satellite", or perhaps these studies may refquire more refined detection for their aims.

## Reflection

For this particular week, I found it interesting to research a satellite of my choice. Despite not having prior experience with Remote Sensing, there were many options to choose from, which was overwhelming at first, but based on being introduced to LiDAR sensors in satellites during week 1, I thought it would be a good idea to explore a satellite that uses LiDAR.  

Given that CALIPSO particularly focuses on cloud-based data, which is a topic that I am not fully aware of its processes or relevance, as I have minimal knowledge of aerosols and the research of it, I still found the research process interesting as I was able to learn about how LiDAR was used in CALIPSO and how certain cloud characteristics could be measured, and how this data can be implemented and examined in research.

I don't exactly know whether I will use data collected from the CALIPSO satellite due to its discontinuation, as there may be more up-to-date satellites that replace CALIPSO with better performance just as they do with Landsat. Additionally, from a human/social geography perspective, I don't think that I will engage with this type of data any time soon, but it could be potentially used if I ever have to conduct cloud-climate related analysis. Despite this, it was interesting to learn about how this satellite functioned during its mission.
